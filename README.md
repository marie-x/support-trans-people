# Introduction

"What's all this fuss about?"

An organized and secretive media campaign has been run against the trans community, originating from the authoritarian end of the political spectrum.

Being trans is like being gay or left-handed. It is an innate trait. Nobody chooses it. The notions of "social contagion" and "rapid-onset gender dysphoria" were fabricated by cisgender people who feel threatened by any change to the social order.

# Ettiquite

- Please don't use a trans person's former name ("deadname") without permission
- If you slip up and use a deadname or an incorrect pronoun, simply correct yourself and move on. Making a big deal about it is awkward. Trans people are painfully aware that they're asking their community to make this effort, and calling attention to it is uncomfortable - but not as uncomfortable as being misgendered or deadnamed.
- There's no such thing as "transgenderism." It's like saying "biologyism" or "physicism." Trans people exist, and no aspect of it is a choice. We may choose to medically transition or not, but a trans person who isn't on hormone therapy is still a trans person.
- Nobody "identifies" as trans. They are, or they aren't. 
- They aren't "preferred" pronouns. They're pronouns, just like cis people's.

# Media

# Arguments

By and large, authoritarians do not argue in good faith, but it can be important to argue with them as a way to sway people who are otherwise unsure how to think about trans issues.

### Puberty blockers

Puberty blockers are used for cis youth all the time.

Forcing someone to go through the wrong puberty is cruel. The "what if you make a mistake" argument dehumanizes trans people.

Children are not property.

## Bathrooms

Bruh this is just pure fascist bullshit.
